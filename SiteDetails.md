### Design Details ###
Design is not really my specialty; I will leave this part up to you. As long as you include the features I want in our site, where everything goes is not a big concern as long as it looks good and user experience is standard. While I do want fancy, I also want to make sure navigation is easy. Here is a kickoff to help you design:

Our church is called The Pasture, which is inspired by Psalm 23. Do what you will to the color scheme and design with that fact. For the landing page, though, I'm thinking of a background photo of a grass with a cross in the middle with our name. Then it will automatically go to the home page using some animation (so users don't have to click a button to go to the hom page). But that's just a suggestion; please take liberty in designing the site your way, following good UI/UX practices and creating a modern church website that's easy to navigate. We are limited in great-looking photos, though, so do try to design it without too many photos. Photos are included in the folder.
